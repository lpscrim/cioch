The front zip is protected by an internal flap, the hood rolls up into a collar and the jacket includes a map pocket and two handwarmer pockets. Weighing in at around 500g, the whole jacket will roll up to the size of a pineapple, but is tougher and more durable than most other 'lightweights' on the market",
