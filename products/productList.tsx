    description: "Our lightest waterproof, the Glamaig has been designed for summer hillwalking and backpacking. The outer shell is made entirely from Paramo Windproof microfibre, so the Glamaig is also incredibly breathable. The sleeves are only lined to the elbows, allowing them to roll up easily for increased ventilation (fully lined sleeves are optional). The front zip is protected by an internal flap, the hood rolls up into a collar and the jacket includes a map pocket and two handwarmer pockets. Weighing in at around 500g, the whole jacket will roll up to the size of a pineapple, but is tougher and more durable than most other 'lightweights' on the market",
