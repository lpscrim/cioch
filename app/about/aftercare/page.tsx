        Washing and Aftercare

        Regular treatment of Nikwax Analogy waterproofs with Nikwax water-based
        products will maintain their high performance indefinitely. This can be
        done in your domestic washing machine with no harm to your appliance or
        the environment. <br />
        <br /> Garments should be kept clean by washing in Nikwax Tech Wash to
        remove dirt, oils and salts and revitalize the water resistance. First
        make sure that your machine is free of detergent powder residue as this
        will impair water repellency, and wash on a 40° synthetic cycle. Cool
        tumble drying is beneficial.
        <br />
        <br /> When water begins to smear into the outer shell fabric during
        use, instead of beading into droplets, the garment should be washed in
        Nikwax TX Direct, again at 40°, following the cleaning cycle. This will
        completely restore water repellency to ‘as new’ levels. Ground-in dirt
        or stains can be removed with household detergent, and oil by dry
        cleaning, but this must be followed by cycles in Tech Wash and TX Direct
        Wash-In to restore water repellency.
