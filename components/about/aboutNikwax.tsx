        Cioch Outdoor Clothing are proud to use ‘Nikwax Analogy’ waterproof
        system developed by Paramo. Rather than create a waterproof barrier
        which limits breathability, this system is about water management,
        providing the most comfortable waterproof clothing around. <br/><br/>  Although
        water can be pushed under pressure through the outer layer (say, by
        kneeling in a puddle), the unique ‘Parameta’ lining fabric acts as a
        pump which quickly expels moisture. <br/><br/>   Also, the system is thought to be
        more breathable than any conventional waterproof fabric, preventing a
        build up of condensation in all weather conditions. Thus, the insulating
        quality of your thermal layers is preserved, keeping you warm and dry.
        <br/><br/> Furthermore, regular washing in Nikwax ‘Tech-Wash’ and ‘TX Direct’ will
        maintain the high performance of your garment indefinitely, unlike
        fabrics with membranes or hydrophilic coatings and taped seams which can
        eventually break down. <br/><br/> The all-round comfort of these garments is
        enhanced by the ‘feel’ of the fabrics used. They are all light and soft
        but very strong, flexible but rustle-free. <br/><br/> Combine the qualities of
        Nikwax Analogy with our Perfect Fit™ service for the most weatherproof,
        breathable, comfortable and durable waterproof clothing you have ever
        worn.
